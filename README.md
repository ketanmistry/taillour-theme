## What is a boilerplate theme?

Taillour is a pre-built, foundational theme with a standard structure and essential code that developers or designers can use as a starting point to create custom Shopify themes more quickly.

## Why use a boilerplate theme?

Retrofitting new features to pre-made themes is incredibly messy and difficult as the codebase is overcrowded with template settings, nested snippets and components.

And, most themes aren't made for customising.
